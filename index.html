          <p> The above link is to flaunt that, technically (and indirectly),
            this website provides access to more information than even the
            great Library of Alexandria at the height of its greatness. Take that ancient Egpyt! </p>

            <p> Here lies an ancient game, now little known to mankind.
               Make sure you have many hours free, for I can't promise you won't get addicted.
               Well don't leave me hanging, check it out!

            <p> What could be funner than exploring this website? <br/>
                (Hint: It's not correcting my use of the word 'funner') <br/>
                It's facts of course! <br/>
                It was also a trick question because this section of fun facts is
                still totally part of this website : )
